\begin{itemize}
\item Book a spot for three at Maid-Rite Sandwich Shop in Antigua and Barbuda. I'll
book a table for you at [\ldots{}]

\section{RoBERTa}
\label{sec:org491ad61}

RoBERTa iterates on BERT's pretraining procedure, including training the model longer, with bigger batches over more data; removing the next sentence prediction objective; training on longer sequences; and dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data.


\section{RoBERTa}
\label{sec:org8edc141}

\begin{itemize}
\item Bi-directional masked language model.
\end{itemize}

\section{What I intended to do -}
\label{sec:orgae2a165}

\begin{itemize}
\item Book a spot for three at Eve's Pizzeria. Which place? \texttt{<mask>}
\end{itemize}

\section{What I intended to do -}
\label{sec:org7a027fc}
\begin{itemize}
\item Book a spot for three at Eve's Pizzeria. Which place? \texttt{<mask>}
\item Book a spot for three at Eve's Pizzeria. Which place? Eve's \texttt{<mask>}
\item Book a spot for three at Eve's Pizzeria. Which place? Eve's Pizzeria
\end{itemize}

\section{What actually happens -}
\label{sec:org5b1a3ca}


\begin{itemize}
\item <s> Book a spot for three at Eve's Pizzeria. Which place? </s>
\end{itemize}

\section{What actually happens -}

\end{itemize}

\section{How to get it to work -}
\label{sec:orgaf19293}

\begin{itemize}
\item Don't use a birdirectional masked language model.
\item Examples of GPT2, a uni-directional transformer model trained for the same
task -
\begin{itemize}
\item add artist to All Out 70s . Where should I add ? All Out 70s
\item Give the current  book a three . What is the rating ? three
\item \url{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MGDjZDdgzxZtAI\_KO2yDEOkRmX3jj2LD}
\end{itemize}
\item Do not use dynamic masking, as the orignal paper did, instead mask only the
final answer.
\begin{itemize}
\item What the paper did -
\begin{itemize}
\item Book a \texttt{<mask>} for three \texttt{<mask>} Eve's Pizzeria. Which place? Eve's
Pizzeria.
\end{itemize}
\item Instead, do -
\begin{itemize}
\item Book a spot for three at Eve's Pizzeria. Which place? \texttt{<mask>
     <mask>}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
